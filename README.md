# Natural-Language-Processing-NLP----Python
In this repository, we (myself and one other contributor) attempted to use numpy, sklearn, pytorch, pandas, and matplotlib in congruence with NLTK in order to perform sentiment analysis. We wanted to create a neural network that would classify words as either strongly positive, weakly positive, strongly negative, or weakly negative. We selected out all movie reviews that were 13 characters in lengthâ€”if they were more or less than 13 their sentiment would not be classified. Furthermore, this neural network had 13 hidden layers and a learning rate of 0.1. The sentiment would be classified by sorting the sentences (after vectorization) into 4 bins and assigning the numerical values of 0, 1, 2, or 3.
